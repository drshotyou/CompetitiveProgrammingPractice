# CompetitiveProgrammingPractice
Holds the code for some of the problems I did in order to prepare for the competitive programming exam that I was required to pass during college

The easy and medium folder problems can be found on hackerrank, my profile here: https://www.hackerrank.com/drshotyou

The Past Exam Problems (as the name implies) are problems from past exams that I also did as practice. 

I will continue adding more code as I keep practicing.
